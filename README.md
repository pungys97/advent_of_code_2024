A friend of mine just introduced me to the **Advent of Code** this year.

It was nice to practice all the basic algorithms from uni again.

I got stuck at **Day 17** for a while. I am indexing from 0.
I read on Reddit that you can solve it with an **evolutionary algorithm**—which seemed really cool—so I gave it a shot but failed to get the right answer.

Totally missed the train on **Day 20** and beyond and never got back to finishing it.
